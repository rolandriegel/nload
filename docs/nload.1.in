.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nload
is a console application which monitors network traffic and bandwidth usage in real time.
It visualizes the in- and outgoing traffic using two graphs and provides additional info
like the total amount of transferred data and min/max network usage.

.SH USAGE
When running
.B nload,
you can switch between the devices (which you gave
.B nload
either on the command line or which were auto-detected) by pressing the left and right arrow keys. If the
.B \-m
command line parameter is given, the arrow keys switch as many devices back and forth as
there are shown on the screen. If you want to quit, do so by pressing 'q' or 'Ctrl+C'.

For further key shortcuts, have a look at the sections
.B MAIN WINDOW
and
.B OPTION WINDOW
below.

.SH OPTIONS
A summary of the options supported by
.B nload
is included below.

.TP
.B \-a period
Sets the length in seconds of the time window for average calculation.
The default is 300.
.TP
.B \-i max_scaling
Specifies the 100% mark in kBit/s of the graph indicating the incoming bandwidth usage.
Use 0 for automatic scaling. Ignored if the switch \-m is given. The default value for max_scaling
is 0 (automatic).
.TP
.B \-m
Show multiple devices at a time; do not show the traffic graphs.
.TP
.B \-o max_scaling
Same as \-i but for the graph indicating the outgoing bandwidth usage.
.TP
.B \-t interval
Determines the refresh interval of the display in milliseconds.
The default value of interval is 500.

PLEASE NOTE:
Specifying refresh intervals shorter than about 100 milliseconds makes traffic
calculation very unprecise. Also the display may flicker using such short
refresh intervals.
.B nload
tries to balance this out by doing extra time measurements, but this may
not always succeed.
.TP
.B \-u h|H|b|B|k|K|m|M|g|G
Sets the type of unit used for the display of traffic numbers.
h means human readable (auto), b Bit/s, k kBit/s, m MBit/s and g GBit/s.
The upper case letters mean the corresponding units in Bytes (instead of Bits).
The default is k.
.TP
.B \-U h|H|b|B|k|K|m|M|g|G
Same as \-u, but for an amount of data, e.g. Bit, kByte, GBit etc. (without "/s").
The default is M.
.TP
.B \-f filename
Appends traffic data to the named file. See the section
.B TRAFFIC LOGGING FORMAT
below for an explanation of the logged information.
.TP
.B devices
Network devices to use. The default is "all", which means to display all auto-detected devices.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show a short summary of these command line options.

.SH MAIN WINDOW
After starting,
.B nload
begins to monitor the network devices given on the
command line, or, if none where specified, the default device. In this mode,
the following key shortcuts are available.

.TP
.B 'ArrowRight', 'ArrowDown', 'PageDown', 'Enter', 'Tab'
Switch the display to the next network device, or, when started with the
.B \-m
flag, to the next page of devices.

.TP
.B 'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowUp', 'PageUp'
Switch the display to the previous network device, or, when started with
the
.B \-m
flag, to the previous page of devices.

.TP
.B 'F2'
Show the option window (see section 
.B OPTION WINDOW
below).

.TP
.B 'F5'
Save current settings to the user's config file.

.TP
.B 'F6'
Reload settings from the config files.

.TP
.B 'q', 'Ctrl+C'
Quit
.BR nload .

.SH OPTION WINDOW
The parameters given to
.B nload
on the command line can be adjusted during run time by pressing the 'F2' key. A
small window appears on the top of the screen, listing the available settings.

.TP
.B 'F2'
Show/hide the option window.

.TP
.B 'ArrowLeft', 'ArrowRight', 'Home', 'End'
Navigate within the edit fields.

.TP
.B 'ArrowUp', 'ArrowDown', 'Enter'
Navigate between the settings.

.TP
.B 'PageUp', 'PageDown', 'Tab'
Toggle between the different values possible for the current field.

.TP
.B '+' / '-'
Switch to the next / previous page of settings.

.SH TRAFFIC LOGGING FORMAT

Traffic is logged as a simple text table, with each line describing the traffic status of a single network device at a specific time.
The first line of output serves as a table header naming each column of data. Columns are separated by a single space character. The meaning of each column is described below.

.TP
.B Date
The date of the log entry in YYYY-MM-DD format, where YYYY is the four-digit year, MM the two-digit month (01-12) and DD the two-digit day (01-31).

.TP
.B Time
The time of the log entry in HH:MM:SS format, where HH, MM and SS are the two-digit hours (00-23), minutes (00-59) and seconds (00-60).

.TP
.B DeviceName
The name of the network device for which this log entry applies.

.TP
.B DataInTotal
The number of bytes received since boot.

.TP
.B DataOutTotal
The number of bytes transmitted since boot.

.TP
.B DataInPerSecond
The number of bytes currently being received per second.

.TP
.B DataOutPerSecond
The number of bytes currently being transmitted per second.

.TP
.B DataInAverage
The number of bytes being received in average, calculated by using the time interval specified with the
.B -a
parameter or configured in the configuration file.

.TP
.B DataOutAverge
The number of bytes being transmitted in average, calculated by using the time interval specified with the
.B -a
parameter or configured in the configuration file.

.TP
.B DataInMin
The absolute minimum number of bytes received per second, calculated since starting
.BR nload .

.TP
.B DataOutMin
The absolute minimum number of bytes transmitted per second, calculated since starting
.BR nload .

.TP
.B DataInMax
The absolute maximum number of bytes received per second, calculated since starting
.BR nload .

.TP
.B DataOutMax
The absolute maximum number of bytes transmitted per second, calculated since starting
.BR nload .

.TP
.B TimeSeconds
The date and time of the log entry as seconds since the Unix Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).

.TP
.B TimeMicroSeconds
The microseconds part of the date and time in
.BR TimeSeconds .

.SH FILES

.TP
.I $(HOME)/.nload
User-specific configuration file (overrides system-wide settings). Press
.B 'F5'
from within nload to save the current settings to this file.

.TP
.I /etc/nload.conf
System-wide configuration file. It uses the same syntax as the user-specific
configuration file.

.TP
.I /sys/class/net/*/* /proc/net/dev
are read by
.B nload
when running on Linux to get the network traffic data.
